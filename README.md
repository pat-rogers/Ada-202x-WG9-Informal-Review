# Ada-202x-WG9-Informal-Review
This is the place for WG 9 members to submit informal comments on the 202x source document. (This is not the formal ballot that WG 9 will hold later in the process.)

We are requesting the following kinds of comments:

  * Formatting issues, typos, grammatical errors, or ambiguous or unclear wording. Semantic issues can be raised and are always of interest, but only problems with simple fixes will be handled at this point in the process. (Suggestions for simple fixes are welcome.) As there are always some issues remaining in every Standard, more complex issues will be deferred to a future Corrigendum or Revision. We are also not at this stage looking for arguments in favor of, or opposed to, particular features. We are taking the feature set of Ada 202x as a given at this point. 

  * For National Body representatives, anything in the text that would cause you to request technical changes when SC 22 holds their official ballot.

We are using the "Issues" interface to submit comments. Individual comments are to be submitted as individual issues, one comment per Issue, with a title indicating the relevant RM paragraph number and comment topic.

**NOTE : You will need a GitHub account to do this. Accounts are easy to set up and cost-free.** If you don't already have an account, go to https://github.com/ in your favorite browser, press the "Sign up" (not "Sign in") button at the far right, and then fill out the requested fields. Don't select anything that isn't free.

How To Submit
-------------

To submit a new comment, first locate the "Issues" tab in the upper left of the page, between the "<> Code" tab and the "Pull requests" tab. Press the "Issues" tab.

A new page will be shown, listing all the open issues (comments). 

At the far right on the page is a green Button with the label "New issue" inside it. Press that button. 

The page content will change to present an interface for entering the title and text of your comment. 

In the "Title" pane, enter the subject RM paragraph number and a brief descriptive topic. The description will help distinguish among comments about the same RM paragraph.

Below the Title pane is the large text pane with a tab labeled "Write", with "Leave a comment" as a gray prompt indicating that the text of your comment goes there. Enter the text of the comment about the paragraph number referenced in the title.

Editing is supported within the text box. You can use the formatting toolbar just above the large text pane containing your comment text.  To see the effect, click on the "Preview" tab.

When ready, press the green "Submit new issue" button at the lower right.

Note that you can use an external text editor to create the text of your comment, if preferred, and then either copy the text from there into the issue's "Write" text pane.

That's it!

Comment Status
--------------

When you consider a comment sufficiently answered (for those that should be answered) you can close the issue. Use the same starting approach to go to the Issues page, and then find the specific comment. Press the Green "Close" button.
